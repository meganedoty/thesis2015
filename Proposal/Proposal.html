                <h3>Potential Outcomes</h3>
                <p>The form your work takes should be impacted by your research into the problem / issue your project is addressing. It’s good to have an idea of where you’re going, but don’t get stuck on your first idea. You’re going to know a LOT more about your topic in a month so maybe that book idea changes to an app, or vice versa. Note: You are required to have a web presence for your thesis project, even if the final outcome is a printed piece or physical object. (500 characters max)</p>
