            <p>Meg Lewis is a print and web designer who works as a part of the freelance studio Ghostly Ferns.

            <p>Frank Chimero has worked as an illustrator, designer and author. His illustrated articles on the web as well as his book, The Shape of Design, are both persuasive and thought provokingly sharp in content, leading to new ideas and insights. His thoughts on designing for print and the web at once (The Great Discontent redesign, for example).</p>
            
            <h4><a href="http://kovalc.in/">Katie Kovalcin</a></h4>
            <p>I first came across Katie Kovalcin from her talk at Smashing Conference NYC 2015 where she spoke about closing the gap between front-end designers and developers. The aesthetic she is able to communicate in her work is also fresh and playful in their use of modern web programming capabilities.</p>

            <p>A designer primarily in print, Philippe Apeloig works with type and grids in to create strong visual impact in really cunning and smart ways. The work he produces is bold, memorable and elegant.</p>
            
            <h4><a href="http://owltastic.com/">Meagan Fisher</a></h4>
            <p>Another (female!) web designer / front-end dev whose work I've found through volunteering. She had spoken at Smashing Conference NYC 2014.</p>

            <p>Potential Outcomes: The form your work takes should be impacted by your research into the problem / issue your project is addressing. It’s good to have an idea of where you’re going, but don’t get stuck on your first idea. You’re going to know a LOT more about your topic in a month so maybe that book idea changes to an app, or vice versa. Note: You are required to have a web presence for your thesis project, even if the final outcome is a printed piece or physical object. (500 characters max)</p>

<p>NOTE: Let’s also be clear about how your outcome might change depending on the feedback you receive. The outcome can/ should change when thoughtful response to the evolution of the project suggests a new solution. Don’t let the myth of the intuitive genius blind you. Your increasingly nuanced and sophisticated understanding of the issues you’re exploring will likely lead you to refinements/ alterations  / rethinking of your plans for the best final products for your project over the next few months.</p>

<p>Methods: technical process, research methods, content gathering strategies, frameworks, materials, or media you intend to use (if you will need to learn technical skills to accomplish your outcome goals, please address this here)</p>
