            <p>Practitioners: five examples of established designers, artists or studios, both present-day and historical, that will inspire your research / process / methodologies (500 characters per example and include a website address, as well as a representative image(s) for each example). Note: This is not a list of “my internet crushes”. This is well-informed, well-researched list of people whose work / practice / processes have meaningful impact on your thesis project.</p>

            <p>Potential Outcomes: The form your work takes should be impacted by your research into the problem / issue your project is addressing. It’s good to have an idea of where you’re going, but don’t get stuck on your first idea. You’re going to know a LOT more about your topic in a month so maybe that book idea changes to an app, or vice versa. Note: You are required to have a web presence for your thesis project, even if the final outcome is a printed piece or physical object. (500 characters max)</p>

<p>NOTE: Let’s also be clear about how your outcome might change depending on the feedback you receive. The outcome can/ should change when thoughtful response to the evolution of the project suggests a new solution. Don’t let the myth of the intuitive genius blind you. Your increasingly nuanced and sophisticated understanding of the issues you’re exploring will likely lead you to refinements/ alterations  / rethinking of your plans for the best final products for your project over the next few months.</p>

<p>Methods: technical process, research methods, content gathering strategies, frameworks, materials, or media you intend to use (if you will need to learn technical skills to accomplish your outcome goals, please address this here)</p>
