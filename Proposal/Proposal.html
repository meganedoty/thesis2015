                <h3>Project Description</h3>
                <p>Studying abroad can be nerve wracking. Especially if one has mental health quarries. The internet is bursting with travel resources and blogs, though usually portraying the experience en rose. The internet is also plentiful with mental health resources, though usually grossly sympathetic in design. Combining these results in a strange mess of confusion. I’m looking to create a platform to fill in the gap: someplace one can find resources free from the sad stigma of mental health help. This may also be a place motivating users to check in — whether it’s been a phenomenal day, or just kind of not great! Because sometimes people simply need to share things, get them out and keep moving. It can also be great to reflect and see how far one has come. Investigating UX/UI, defining voice and style, and using web technologies will result in such a platform that accepts anxiety, depression, stress, and other mental health qualms as normal roadblocks that overcoming is nevertheless attainable.</p>

                <h3>Topic Background</h3>
                <p>The stigma behind mental health creates a force where it almost feels shameful to admit struggle. The goal with this thesis project would not be to eliminate stigma completely, but to acknowledge that it is a reason why numbers of students would go abroad without giving this information and thus not be given information that could help. It would fill in a gap where resources dealing with such a situation are difficult to find, and would work to provide a sense of normalcy.

                <h3>Environmental Scan</h3>
                <h4>helpguide.org</h4>
                <p>Resources on an array of health points. Their site uses soft colors, natural, sympathetic, first person, clean / sanitary, retirement home, and concerning imagery. The aesthetic used does not leave the user at ease or confident in their ability to get past any difficulties.</p>
                
                <h4>MIUSA — Mobility International USA</h4>
                <p>Extensive resource section. Hard / crisp aesthetic. Can filter by type of diability, location. Stories highlighting successes often written after the writer has returned to their home country. Adds an accessible PDF at the end of each article.</p>
                
                <h4>Experience project</h4>
                <p>The site is clean in design and appears to be targeted aesthetically to young adults and university students. Users can create groups or make small posts similar to tweets that other users may reply to. The idea is there, but moderation is lacking; the result is a lot of irrelevant material better suited for other social media platforms.</p>
                
                <h4>Misc forums</h4>
                <p>Vicissitudes of forums regarding both study abroad and mental health exist. These typically use a generic structure (no need to reinvent the wheel) for creating threads and replies. Straightforward, to the point, and personalized answers.</p>
                
                <h4>University international programs website</h4>
                <p>It appears that most universities have some sort of site set up for their international programs. The one set up for SUNY New Paltz gives general information about a program, accessible to the general public. After registering as a user one gains access to more materials as relevant to the program they are applying for. Only after being accepted to a program do informational documents on health and safety abroad become available.</p>

                <h3>Potential Outcomes</h3>
                <p>This project will adress the issue of a lack of resources pertaining to mental health quarries and study abroad. It will present information in a normalized manner and be freely accessible. During the design and development process, students at SUNY New Paltz will be the primary audience. Initial functionality includes building a resource hub while designing for scalability, and the intention to add registered users later on. The project will primarily focus on the web, but may also include a poster series to and social media materials as promotion.</p>
                
                <h3>Methods</h3>
                <p>This project will use web technlogies to take form. This includes standard HTML / CSS markup, exploring SASS as a pre-processing language for writing CSS, jQuery and Javascript for interaction, some PHP, and using Bootstrap as a framework. Posters and social media materials will also be created within the Adobe Creative Suite. The Center for International Programs and the Health Center will be consulted for assistance on putting together information. Technical skills to learn include implementing user registration later on, which would detail saving information as well as generating content.</p>
